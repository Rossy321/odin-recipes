 <h2>Description </h2>
 <p>A delicious recipe for scones which uses soy milk and vegan spread to replace the dairy.</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
 <ul>
<li>350g self-raising flour, extra for dusting</li>

<li>¼ tsp salt</li>

<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>

<li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>

<li>95g vegan vegetable spread</li>

<li>150ml soy milk, plus extra to glaze</li>

<li>jam, to serve</li>

<li>vegan cream alternative, e.g. oat-based crème fraîche, to serve</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

<Ol>
  
  <li> Mix the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar in a bowl. Rub in the vegetable spread until you have fine breadcrumbs. You can also gradually pulse it in a food processor until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
  
  <li>Gradually stir the milk into the flour mixture until you have a smooth dough.</li>

  <li>Lightly dust your surface with flour and gently roll out the scone dough until 2cm thick. Transfer onto a baking tray lined with parchment and put it in the fridge for 30 mins to firm up.</li>

  <li>Remove the dough from the fridge and using a 7cm cutter, cut out the scones. Put them, top side down, onto another baking sheet lined with paper, leaving a 2cm gap between each one. This gives the scones an even top. Brush with the extra milk, making sure that it doesn’t drip onto the sides (otherwise they will rise unevenly). Put the scones in the freezer for 15 mins. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Remove from the freezer and bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown. Serve with jam and vegan cream, if you like.</li>
